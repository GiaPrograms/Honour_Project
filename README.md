JIA - TO DO list


1. - Usability:
	- evaluate the flow of the app (easy to use) - together
	- change sliders to a more easy to use option - amy
	- Check letter size recommendation in terms of usability and change if necessary - together
	- Check display of results – see usability standards – ask Professor - Le
	- Improve the tabs of the results. Users don’t realize that those are already the results - Nathan
	- Improve the icone “i” to make it more clear what it means. Colors? Ideas? - Le
	- improve icones (likes/hearts) – Amy
	- include feedback of users (Karine will send list of info from users) – N/A -LE
	- it is not clear that each study is clickable – Nathan 
	- Check possible changes in the parts of favorite/plan/results. Seems to be overlapping and confusing. 	Not easy to understand differences. – together
	- Check layout on the phone. – ask Mohamad - Le


2.5. - Admin dashboard: Display data for the admin to view, based on all user data (# user that used; how often it was used; statistics goal, favorites, plan, chosen treatments). Download pdf the dashboard analysis. Allow to download the information of all users in a csv file (one line for each utilization). Add the time that each user spend with the app. Add an alert in the beginning with time idle.
- Check behaviour when idle time is reached. Currently, do we store the information up to that point or not? Wanted: save information and save that it is unfinished (it timed out).

2.5. - Bilingual support: The current database structure and queries do not support a bilingual approach. Check the different possible design approaches to implement a database which handles bilingual input.

What is the best way to provide the information to translate?

4.- User dashboard: Show the user their progress and history for different stats, such as their pain level changes over time, selected treatments and favorites over time, etc. All of this information is stored within the “logs” table within the database. Every time they use the app, there should be a button that allows to review their progress. Show: the treatments they were using and the pain evolution. The goal is to provide some feedback on the evolution of the treatments and the pain levels, how effective they were. Pair the pain with the added/removed treatments.
